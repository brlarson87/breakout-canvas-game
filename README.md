# breakout-canvas-game
Add on to Brad Traversy's Breakout canvas game with level changes and difficulty increases.

Link to Brad's course where he builds the initial single level game ---->https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/

Addons to this project done by me:
    1. Color themes for level changes
    2. Level changes when bricks are replaced
    3. Score per brick increased at harder levels and a highest score is kept for the current session (not persistent)
    4. Difficulty increases at each level (Smaller paddle at each level and faster ball at every other level)
